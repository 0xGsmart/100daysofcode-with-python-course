# Using Python + Github APIÂ¶

Welcome to this lesson. I prepared [a notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/61-63-github-api/github-api.ipynb) so you can follow along.

## Day 1: Exploring the PyGithub module

In this lesson I will show you how to use [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) to retrieve public data from Github profiles. Secondly I will show you how to automatically create a gist.

Today you follow along with the videos and my notebook.

## Day 2 and 3: Practice

Now you got the basics down, it's time to start using the Github API with Python yourself, some ideas for projects to work on you can find [in my notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/61-63-github-api/github-api.ipynb).

You can use PyGithub or any other wrapper module, as long as you use Python :)

## Time to share what you've accomplished!
