# Using Python Selenium to Automate TasksÂ¶

Welcome to this lesson. I prepared [a notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/73-75-selenium/python-selenium.ipynb) so you can follow along.

## Day 1: Selenium by Example

[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) is a great tool to write functional/acceptance tests and automation scripts that require interaction with a webpage.

In this lesson we get Selenium running and look at two use cases. Then we have you code 1 or 2 scripts using Selenium.

Sit back and watch the videos and use [my notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/73-75-selenium/python-selenium.ipynb) if you want to try the examples out yourself.

## Day 2 and 3: Practice time!

Now it's your turn. The goal is to have you get your hands dirty using Python Selenium. 

Check out [the notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/73-75-selenium/python-selenium.ipynb) for some pointers. A nice exercise is [PyBites Code Challenge 32 - Test a Simple Django App With Selenium ](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/32/) - try to complete it and PR your work.

## Time to share what you've accomplished!
